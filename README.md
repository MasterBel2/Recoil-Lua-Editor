# Lua File Editor
A file editing widget for Beyond All Reason.

## Install
Lua File Editor is installable with the Master Widget Installer (available on Discord), or otherwise installable by merging the contents of the Widgets folder into your Beyond All Reason installation's widgets directory. 

Lua File Editor depends on [MasterBel2's GUI Framework](https://github.com/MasterBel2/Master-GUI-Framework). Mainline dev currently targets the GUI framework's mainline development branch: use `local requiredFrameworkVersion = "Dev"`. Individual releases are planned to be packaged with a specific release version of the framework, e.g. `local requiredFrameworkVersion = 42`.
